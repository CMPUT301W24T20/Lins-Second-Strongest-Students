Project Check-In 2:
1. Product Backlog

  - Form the backlog from initial user stories
  - Estimate user stories' sizes using story points
  - Denote risk level for each user story
  - Also number them for easy reference
  - Note which story will be released for the half-way checkpoint

2. User Interface Mockup

  Basic text description of discussed UI:
  Open app: login page. Can be skipped. Potentially uses device ID instead of username/password
  After login: open camera (like snapchat). Tab in corner for profile edit, another tab for My Events
  Profile: display name, contact info, homepage, profile picture. Can be edited
  My Events: show list of previously scanned codes? allow for event creation?
